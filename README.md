This is a little project I put together to showcase some of my skills and interests. I trained the TensorFlow model a year or so ago and recently built an interface using React to allow a user to upload 
an image and apply a transformation. The model and client side run on two separate docker images. A video demonstration can be found at [https://youtu.be/AjtPZz-6dXk]

I would like to eventually deploy this application, although it will be expensive to keep deployed due to the large model size...
